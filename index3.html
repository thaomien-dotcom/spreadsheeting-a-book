    <p>In Shadowbook: Writing Through the Digital 2014-2018, Miriam Rasch investigates these questions in five experimental essays and one exposition. From the way the smartphone molds the language of desire and friendship to the possibilities of writing a ‘spreadsheet novel’ – Shadowbook is a testimony to post-digital writing by way of writing. It salutes both the beauty of the web and what hides in the shadows. Even in the bright and shiny sphere of the digital, the dark side is never far off." - </p>

  <p>“What urgent publishing can mean (…) is that it pertains not only to speed but also to relevancy. In short, urgency goes beyond the ‘now’ and connects to the afterlife of a publication; it understands quality not just as logically consistent and well-proven arguments, but also as alternative content structures; and asks to view positioning a publication not as getting as many clicks or conversions as possible, but primarily as finding and engaging the readers who care. In other words, urgency means prolonging the life of a publication beyond short attention spans, challenging your readers to navigate and interact with content in different ways, and entrusting your content to the network.” -</p>

 <p class="big"><span class="spreadsheeting">Spreadsheeting A Book</span> is inspired by a chapter of the Shadowbook - ‘Notes towards a spreadsheet novel’ and is brought back to you with an urgent choice of media and way of conveying.</p>
<div class="fourth-about">
    
    <h1>Why ’Notes towards a spreadsheet novel’?</h1>
    <p >Miriam Rasch examines the complex role of spreadsheets in both the modern office and as a metaphor for larger systems of organization. While spreadsheets promise transparency and efficiency, they also introduce a form of unpredictability and complexity, confining individuals to rigid, formulaic structures. The chapter highlights the tension between the perceived clarity of spreadsheets and the hidden chaos beneath their surface, reflecting on how these tools shape both the individual and the collective experience. Spreadsheets are depicted as a "gray medium" that can provoke fear, admiration, and ultimately numbness, as users become overwhelmed by the sheer volume of data and its implications.</p>
    <h1 class="heading-right">How is it Urgent?</h1>
    <p>The spreadsheet’s rigid grid strips away the nuance of human experience, flattening life’s richness into rows and columns. In an age where data dominates decision-making and algorithms shape narratives, this project urgently intervenes, turning a system of numbers into one of words and stories. It reclaims the organic, layered, and deeply human elements often lost in oversimplified structures, offering a necessary counterbalance to the increasingly mechanized lens through which we view the world today.</p>

  <h1>API Are.na</h1>
  <p>To add depth to an urgent way of reading shadowbook, I found it necessary to add a reader's perspective. Shadowbook channel found on Are.na seems like the collector has read the book and created this channel. The information from this channel is fetched into the spreadsheeting book for another point of view while you scroll through the interactive book </p>
